# Description

The Library Information System is an application that allows its users to manage a library environment. With a few simple steps, anyone can use the application. The application offers many features, as it allows us to add, remove, and modify data in the database.

For example, you can monitor and edit the number of books available in our inventory, collect customer information for quick communication via email or phone, track the arrival and departure times of each customer, check the dates and details of each loan, and record upcoming events for children or adults.
